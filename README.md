## Have a [Novation Launchpad](http://us.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad#)?

So do I! The Pentaphone now integrates with this cool piece of music tech. For an alternate playing interface and a cool light show, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
1. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't already have it.
1. ```cd``` to the directory you installed the project in.
1. ```npm install``` to get all dependencies.
1. Attach your Launchpad via USB.
1. ```npm start``` to start the node server. The Launchpad should light up.
1. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the Pentaphone page.

You're ready to go! Play either the keyboard on your computer or the highlighted buttons on your Launchpad: it works the same either way.

Press the upper-left key in the Launchpad grid to turn off the Launchpad.
Use ```ctrl-c``` at the command-line to stop the app itself.

Enjoy!
